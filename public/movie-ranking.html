<h1>The Best Movies According to Grace</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>The Trap</h3>
<p>This is my favorite movie. From what I remember, it's 
    about a serial killer who was trapped by the police in
    a concert event. The plot twist really got me still
    thinking today.

<h3>The Hangover</h3>
<p>The best comedy movie I've watched. I really laugh the entire movie. </p>
<h3>Click</h3>
<p>This is an Adam Sandler movie. It is a comedy but it
    stung in the heart with all the realizations at the end.</p>
